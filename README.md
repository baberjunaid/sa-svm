This project aims to classify customer feedback of roman Urdu on E-commerce websites into three basic classes; positive, negative, and neutral. We have used SVM with Urdu stemming. The paper is submitted into PeerJ Journal for the publications. Currently, the paper is under review.  The dataset and other related configurations and details will be shared on the same link once the paper is accepted for the publications.  The online demo using Flask is also deployed which can be accessed online using http://sa-svm.mlcs.xyz/.

To run this code, make sure that sci-kit learn have the same version mentioned in requirements.txt to avoid any version conflicts.
